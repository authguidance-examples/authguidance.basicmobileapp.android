0. Review classes for similarity to SPA
   Consider avoiding storing the whole mainActivity in fragments

1. User info updates to be same as for desktop app
   Recover from network error should reget user info

2. Display session id in UI
   Long press to cause error + fix desktop sample 2

3. Deep link URLs as company=2 and update blog
   Aim to improve navigation code

4. Stack traces to review in line with Web UI stack traces
   Only show in debug mode + improve display with smaller text
