TODO
----
0. Are there problems leaving an app for 10 minutes half way through login?
1. Handle concurrent fragment errors and use a link + popup dialog
2. Update config to support Okta
3. Can I improve on deep linking hacky implementation, perhaps by using Android navigation classes?
4. Build APK and understand signature / version details being written and use of JDK
