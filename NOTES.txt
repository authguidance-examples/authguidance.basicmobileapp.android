PRIORITY
--------
1. Add a device not secured fragment and reduce code in main activity
   Get rid of blank fragment and make companies the default
   Ensure that deep links do not run views they should not

2. Can I force redraws within fragments via binding and state fields that are watched?
   I need a better understanding of Jetpack data binding

3. Remove instances of finding fragments / activities and calling methods on them
   Only reference to parent is in onAttach
   ErrorSummary should find parent fragment --> if not found then use activity
   Getting a fragment and asking it to re-render might be OK

4. Reload is broken

MINOR
-----
1. Test back navigation after a deep link to transactions
   Navigate back to the home view after a company id of 3 / abc used to use this
   However, API errors show in back navigation so remove this type of code since it adds complexity

    that.mainActivity.navController.popBackStack()
    that.mainActivity.onHome()
