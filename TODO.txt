1. Recycler to list basics, which will look rough, but should scroll
   Companies rendering
   Transactions rendering
   Remove callbacks

2. Use shared styles and colors

1. User info race condition where it does not receive the initial navigate event
   Consider this logic across all samples

2. Reduce library dependencies

3. Test on tablet, since previously I had different styles
