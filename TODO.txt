1. Generally views will be recreated but not view models
   Android uses events but will this works across all UI tech?
   Think this through tomorrow

2. Get rid of MainActivitySharedViewModel
   Get rid of activity events - not useful when view is recreated
   - isInLoginRequired can be derivable in the userInfo view
     Split navigationHelper into two classes perhaps
   Events called by Header buttons fragment:
   - onHome
   - onExpireAccessToken
   - onExpireRefreshToken
   - onLogout

3. Unregister for events on destroy in both activities and fragments
   Do a search on all registers and debug this also

4. Update work repos
